The main idea is to keep track of which candidates B beats, and then which candidates those candidates beat, and so on... You can think of B as an octopus 🐙 spreading tentacles out, then whoever is touched will also spread their tentacles out, and so on. We are trying to find out whether the tentacles ever reach A.

Set up an array with one element for each candidate. This is for you to mark (with 1's) candidates that have been "visited". Initialize with 0's, except for B.
Check the locked array to see who B beats. Tick them off in our visited array. For example, if B beats F and G, now the visited array would hold 1 (or true) at those indices.
Iterate through the locked array again, this time for B, F and G, and see who is beaten by them. Mark these new candidates in the visited array.
Repeat step 3 until either:
'A' gets added to the visited set, which means it would make a cycle, so you can't lock A-B. Or
Nobody new is marked in the visited set, in which case there is no path from B to A, so you can now lock A-B.
 

function pathExists(X, Y) {
    create 'visited' array with size = num_of_candidates, initialize to all 0.
    set array to 1 (true) for candidate X's number.
    make a flag variable to keep track of whether anyone new is added, set to 1 initially.

    while flag is 1,
        set flag to 0.
        for each candidate i in the visited array
            for each other candidate j  // check the 'locked' array
                if i beats j in the locked array and j is not marked as visited {
                    mark j as visited (1)
                    set flag to 1
                }
    
    return [whether Y is visited].
